# DES by python GUI

Main DES python implementation is referred to the following link : https://github.com/RobinDavid/pydes

I changed little things
1. Name of variation(for visibility)
2. Little error
3. My DES based on HEXA Plaintext(and HEXA keys, Cypertext)

And I made GUI by PyQt5
form.ui : form made by QtDesigner
form.py : python form file by pyuic5
des.py : main file, you should compile this python file for run GUI DES
